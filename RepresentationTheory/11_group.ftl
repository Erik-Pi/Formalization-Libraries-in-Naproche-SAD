Definition. A group is an object G such that
     (|G| is a set)
 and (1{G} < G)
 and (for all a,b < G   : a *{G} b < G)
 and (for all a < G     : inv{G} a < G)
 and (for all a < G     :       a *{G} 1{G} = a)
 and (for all a < G     :          a /{G} a = 1{G})
 and (for all a,b,c < G : a *{G} (b *{G} c) = (a *{G} b) *{G} c).
