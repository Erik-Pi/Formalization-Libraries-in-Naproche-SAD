Theorem. Let A be an algebra over K. Let M1,M2 be modules over A over K. Let f be a modulehom over A
 over K from M1 to M2. Hom(K,A,f,-) is a natural transformation
 from Hom(K,A,M2,-) to Hom(K,A,M1,-) over Mod(K,A) to Mod(K,K).
Proof.
 Mod(K,A) is a category.
 K is an algebra over K.
 Mod(K,K) is a category.
 Take F = Hom(K,A,M2,-).
 Take G = Hom(K,A,M1,-).
 F is a functor from Mod(K,A) to Mod(K,K).
 G is a functor from Mod(K,A) to Mod(K,K).
 Take n = Hom(K,A,f,-).
 Let us show that n is a natural transformation from F to G over Mod(K,A) to Mod(K,K).
  Let us show that for all N < Mod(K,A) : n(N) << Mod(K,K)(F(N),G(N)).
   Let N < Mod(K,A).
   N is a module over A over K.
   n(N) = Hom(K,A,-,N)(f).
   F(N) = Hom(K,A,-,N)(M2).
   G(N) = Hom(K,A,-,N)(M1).
   Hom(K,A,-,N) is a contravariant functor from Mod(K,A) to Mod(K,K).
   Let us show that f << Mod(K,A)(M1,M2).
    |Hom(K,A,M1,M2)| is the set of modulehoms over A over K from M1 to M2.
    f < Hom(K,A,M1,M2).

   Take H = Hom(K,A,-,N).
   H is a contravariant functor from Mod(K,A) to Mod(K,K).
   M1,M2 < Mod(K,A).
