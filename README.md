# Formalization Libraries in Naproche-SAD
Appendix to my bachelor thesis in mathematics (University of Bonn).

To run my algebra formalizations, install Naproche-SAD
```
https://files.sketis.net/Isabelle_Naproche-20190611/
```
and paste the folder of my [Algebra Library](./naproche-20190418-original/examples/AlgebraLibrary) inside Naproche-SAD's examples directory.

To try out my library upgrade and the new "learn" command, copy the files in [naproche-20190418-upgrade](./naproche-20190418-upgrade), replace the corresponding original files and run
```
stack build
```
in your naproche-20190418 directory.

The exact changes in the code are highlighted [here](./commit/c13e50702f619757f28fcb67d60c8251b51882fb).
