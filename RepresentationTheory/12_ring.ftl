Definition. A ring is an object R such that
     (R is an abelian group)
 and (1{R} < R)
 and (for all a,b < R   : a *{R} b < R)
 and (for all a < R     :       a *{R} 1{R} = a)
 and (for all a < R     :       1{R} *{R} a = a)
 and (for all a,b,c < R : a *{R} (b *{R} c) = (a *{R} b) *{R} c)
 and (for all a,b,c < R : a *{R} (b +{R} c) = (a *{R} b) +{R} (a *{R} c))
 and (for all a,b,c < R : (a +{R} b) *{R} c = (a *{R} c) +{R} (b *{R} c)).
